                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
                    EMFORCO was born in 2025 from the will of historians and citizens to put the emphasis on forced conscription, 
                    while celebrating 80th anniversaries of WWII end.
                    <br>Forced conscription has always been a polarizing topic among European people, but the current geopolitical 
                    environment forced us to act towards the recognition of forced conscription as one of the highest crimes 
                    during WWII.
                    <br>We are enjoying an era of peace and fraternity that has shown its fragility. EMFORCO aims to reinforce 
                    people’s sovereignty and their right to decide their own fate by explaining, educating and advocating against 
                    forced conscription in Europe.
